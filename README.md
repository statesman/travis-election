GeoJSON of the Travis County Precincts
======================================

First pass at getting this info. It is based on a shapefile found on the [Travis County Voter Registration Department](http://www.traviscountytax.org/goVotersJurisdictionInfo.do) webiste. That shapefile was opened in QGIS and a Save As performed as GeoJSON. No other changes. Didn't check projection or anything.
